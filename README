Random Text Generator written in Go

Install Go (http://golang.org) and compile the gotext.go file. If you want a pre-compiled executable that's working on an Intel-based OS X 10.5, grab gotext and run it.

The rest works almost exactly like in the original Random Text Generator in http://rtext.heroku.com.

Have fun but don't shoot me if the code seems a bit ugly. This is my first attempt at writing a Go application.
